# Custom Durability (1.19.4 only for now)
A Fabric Mod that allows for changing the durabilities of items.

# 🌐 Overview
Change any item's durability using the Config Screen or with a Command!

Should work on Integrated Servers and Dedicated Servers.
Requires [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>), [FAPI](<https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api>), and optionally [Mod Menu](<https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu>) (for the config screen)
Need on Client: ✅  Need on Server: ✅

**Haven't tested modded items, I'm mainly just targetting this mod for Vanilla, since it's what I wanted... it probably? should? work with modded items?**

# 🕮 Details
Currently you use Item IDS and Item Tags to specify what items get what durability.

To set a diamond pickaxe's durability to 5000:
**With the command you'd do**:
`/customdurability set diamond_pickaxe 5000`
**With the Config Screen you'd do**:
`diamond_pickaxe,5000`
