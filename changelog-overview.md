## Overview:
- Added wildcards (`*`)
- Added the `/cd context` command
- `/cd set` has changed how you set an item
- `/cd list` now include visual buttons to remove or edit.
- Item command suggestions will only include damage-able items now *(this could backfire if some items don't work with the way I check for 'damage-able' items, so let me know if some items aren't showing!)*
- Developing for old Minecraft versions should be easier now, the codebase is now based on stonecutter!
