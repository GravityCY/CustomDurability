A Command to set the durability, using the Item ID or a Tag

## âœ– Armor Multiplier
The Armor Multiplier option is so that you can use a base vanilla value that will multiply
your inputted durability, so if you put 5 for boot armor, it would get multiplied by 13, so you'd get what, 65?
(this is how vanilla does it, and is why helmets, chestplates, leggings and boots don't share the same durability)

**Default Multipliers**:
+ <span style="color:gray;">**Helmet**</span>: 11
+ <span style="color:gray;">**Chestplate**</span>: 16
+ <span style="color:gray;">**Leggings**</span>: 15
+ <span style="color:gray;">**Boots**</span>: 13

## ðŸ•® Helpful Tags
I added some tags that should help with some of the more common items:

* `#cd:tools`
  * `wood`
  * `stone`
  * `iron`
  * `gold`
  * `diamond`
  * `netherite`
* `#cd:armor`
  * `leather`
  * `chainmail`
  * `iron`
  * `gold`
  * `diamond`
  * `netherite`

You'd use these by for example doing:
* For Wooden Tools: `#cd:tools/wood`
* For Leather Armor: `#cd:armor/leather`
